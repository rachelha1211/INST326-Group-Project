Final Project Documentation

Summary of project:
For our final project, we have programmed a personal finance tracker. It allows the user to track their expenses per week making for a simple yet effective way of 
recording expenses. One of its functions is being able to add an expense that includes information about its amount, date of spending, and category and being able to view 
inputted expense in a list format; it also calcuates expense totals for each category listed. In addition our program also allows for the deletion of expenses if necessary.

Instructions for running tracker:
Enter into a terminal and type in "python (or python 3 if on mac) finance_tracker_gui.py. It should run automatically from there.

Understanding output:
When the program runs, a second screen should pop up, allowing the user to choose an assortment of actions through buttons as stated in the summary. With each click of a button, another screen will pop up specifically for that action.
